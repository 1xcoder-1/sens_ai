# Application Security Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the security measures implemented in the AI Career Coach application to protect all routes and ensure only authenticated users can access the application.

## Route Protection

### Middleware Implementation
The application uses Clerk middleware to protect all routes by default. Only specific public routes are accessible without authentication:

- Landing page (`/`)
- Sign-in routes (`/sign-in/*`)
- Sign-up routes (`/sign-up/*`)
- API routes (`/api/*`)
- Static assets (images, fonts, etc.)

All other routes require authentication.

### Protected Routes
The following routes are protected and require user authentication:
- Dashboard (`/dashboard`)
- Resume Builder (`/resume/*`)
- Interview Prep (`/interview/*`)
- AI Cover Letter (`/ai-cover-letter/*`)
- Chat (`/chat`)
- Onboarding (`/onboarding/*`)

## Authentication Utilities

### `requireAuth()`
A utility function that ensures a user is authenticated and returns the user's database record. Throws an error if the user is not authenticated or not found.

Usage:
```javascript
import { requireAuth } from "@/lib/auth";

export async function someServerAction() {
  const { user, userId } = await requireAuth();
  // Proceed with authenticated user
}
```

### `checkAuth()`
A utility function that checks if a user is authenticated without throwing an error. Returns null values if not authenticated.

Usage:
```javascript
import { checkAuth } from "@/lib/auth";

export async function someServerAction() {
  const { user, userId } = await checkAuth();
  if (!user) {
    // Handle unauthenticated user
    return;
  }
  // Proceed with authenticated user
}
```

## Server Action Security

All server actions have been updated to use the `requireAuth()` utility to ensure:
1. Users must be authenticated to access any server action
2. Users can only access their own data
3. Proper error handling for unauthenticated requests

## Data Access Control

The application implements row-level security by ensuring users can only access data that belongs to them:
- Resume data is tied to user IDs
- Cover letters are tied to user IDs
- Interview assessments are tied to user IDs
- User profiles are protected by authentication

## Best Practices Implemented

1. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security including middleware, server actions, and database constraints
2. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Users can only access their own data
3. **Secure by Default**: All routes are protected unless explicitly made public
4. **Centralized Authentication**: All authentication checks use the same utility functions
5. **Error Handling**: Proper error handling for authentication failures

## Future Security Enhancements

1. Rate limiting for API endpoints
2. Additional input validation and sanitization
3. Audit logging for sensitive operations
4. Two-factor authentication support
5. Session management improvements
